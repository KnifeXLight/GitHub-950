            Growing up, I never really had hobbies or interests I can call my own. I would often change my hobbies and
            interests growing up, joining multiple clubs and events, trying to see which one piques my interest. I
            participated in sporting events such as swimming, tennis, and Taekwondo. I attended arts and fine arts class
            including band classes, music classes and painting classes. Growing up, I played violin professionally and
            ended up with RCM level 10 at the end. At school, I attended academic clubs and writing clubs; I was
            especially interested in poetry club as it allowed me to express myself in a writing. <br>
            <br>
            However, trying all these interests out, I found myself still unable to call something my own. While in my
            third year of university, I had a sudden epiphany about myself. I reflected upon my entire life and found a
            common interest while growing up. I realized that I watched Anime and read Manga growing up. I never thought
            watching and reading was a hobby and was just an activity to pass time. I was also told growing up that
            watching Anime and reading Manga was childish and was a phase I will grow out of. This was a wrong way of
            thinking. <br>
            <br>
            I left my comfort zone and joined the Anime Club at my university. This club was inviting, diverse, and was
            also where I met a few of my closest friends. In this club I learned about the different paths of the Anime
            Fandom such as reviewers, online gamers, boardgamers, writers, and artists. I explored more into the
            different paths and found myself finding interest in two of the paths; the reviewing path and cosplaying
            path.

            Cosplaying is a combination of two words, costume and playing. Cosplayers are the people who participate in
            cosplaying; do note that cosplayers are artists. Cosplayers will design, create, and modify the
            <b>COSTUMES</b> of fantasy characters. Then in photoshoots or conventions, the cosplayers will dress up in
            the costume and <b>PLAY</b> as the fantasy character by acting as the character. Cosplaying combines the
            skills of design, creation, adapting, and acting.<br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <p id="bodyinfo" style="text-align: left;">
            As for me, I was first introduced to the world of cosplaying by my friend Camille. She is a professional
            cosplayer who has over 10 years of experience cosplaying. She introduced me to her network of friends and
            cosplayers where I learned tips and tricks of designing costumes and also acting. As part of the acting
            lessons, I learned from my friends on how to develop the body shape for the cosplay; which type of workout
            will train which muscle group. So, I could include gymming as a interest.<br>
